## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project took me a lot of time because it was from the Junior section but I was able to finish it while learning new things about CSS Grid and how it works.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
}
```
